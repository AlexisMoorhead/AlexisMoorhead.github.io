                <p>Project Description: A commission for a film company's branding logo. "Prominyo" is the greek word for foreshadow which plays into the inspiration of the company's conception. Schrodinger's Cat was a focal point of inspiration for them as well and we wanted to create a sense of duality to represent multiple realities existing at once. To bring these ideas to a visual representation I utilized a dual colorscheme of blue and purple, the color scheme of their next film, with an accent of yellow to bring focus towards the cat in Schrodinger's box. I chose to place the box and cat as the first "O" in the wording to create a visual reference for the thought experiment and a sense of playfulnes. We chose a sans serif font with a slim body for a clean look that could work with multiple film genres so it does not look too playful or serious. The beveled structure I painted and color palette were chosen to bring an almost crystalized appearance as well as a formidable structure that has substance and weight. The box and cat were also used for the brand's iconic graphic as well. </p>
